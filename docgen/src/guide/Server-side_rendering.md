React InstantSearch builds the Algolia query based on every widget declared. That's why at the first rendering there are no results yet. This is inconvenient when doing server side rendering as the html generated by the server will not contain any hits. 

If you want to have a server side rendering application using React InstantSearch you can use the special API entries we provide for this particular use-case: 

* a new type of `<InstantSearch>` is available under `'react-instantsearch/server'`
* a `findResults` function is available under `'react-instantsearch/server'`

Let's see how it works!

First you will need to get the first results using the `findResults` function. This function takes two parameters: 

* Your <InstantSearch/> instance
* A parameters object containing a `searchState`. This is optional and useful only if you are passing a `searchState` to your `<InstantSearch/>` instance. 

Then, once you'll get those results, you can actually give it as a prop to your `<InstantSearch/>` instance. You'll need a mechanism to render your app after fetching those results.  

We built a next.js application demonstrating those concepts. [Go check out the example](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/tree/master/packages/react-instantsearch/examples/next-app)
