React InstantSearch is compatible with server-side rendering. 

We provide two API entries to handle it: 

* a new type of `<InstantSearch>` available under `'react-instantsearch/server'`
* a `findResults` function available under `'react-instantsearch/server'`

Let's see how it works!

First you will need to get the first results using the `findResults` function. This function takes two parameters: 

* Your <InstantSearch/> instance
* A parameters object containing a `searchState`. This is optional and useful only if you are passing a `searchState` to your `<InstantSearch/>` instance. 

Then, once you'll get those results, you can actually give it as a prop to your `<InstantSearch/>` instance. 

Check out our [Next.js example](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/tree/master/packages/react-instantsearch/examples/next-app) showing you how it works. This example handle URL synchronization.  

> Note:
> React InstantSearch builds the Algolia query based on every widget declared. That’s why at the first rendering there are no results yet. This is inconvenient when doing server side rendering as the html generated by the server will not contain any hits.
