# Commits guidelines

We use [conventional changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog),
please [follow the rules for committing](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/blob/master/conventions/angular.md), it helps reducing the commit noise.

Examples:

- feat(slider): add new range option
- fix(refinementList): send the full algolia result to the noResults template
